To make it fit the rule, the arrow must point to that side, which means pointing it upwards." },

Applying this to C: the pentagon becomes a hexagon, and the two vertical lines rotate 90 degrees to become two horizontal lines." },

    { "id": 177, "section": "Abstract Reasoning", "questionText": "If Figure C were a triangle with a horizontal line inside, what would the transformed figure be?", "options": {"A":"A square with a vertical line.","B":"A pentagon with a horizontal line.","C":"A square with a horizontal line.","D":"A triangle with a vertical line."}, "visual_id": "analogy_2", "correctAnswer": "A", "explanation": "The triangle (3 sides) would become a square (4 sides). The horizontal line would rotate 90 degrees clockwise to become a vertical line." },

Figure C only has reflectional symmetry and does not look the same after any rotation." },

This property is known as rotational symmetry." },

Figure B (the plus) has four. Figure C has one. Figure D (the triangle) has one." }
